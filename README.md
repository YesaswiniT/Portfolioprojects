In this project, the goal is to conduct thorough data exploration and cleaning using SQL across diverse datasets. The initial steps involve importing and examining datasets to understand their structures and types. SQL queries will be employed for data cleaning, addressing missing values, and ensuring overall data consistency. This methodology is applicable to various projects, showcasing the adaptability of SQL in handling diverse datasets. Furthermore, the strategy extends to the creation of Tableau dashboards, utilizing SQL for calculating descriptive statistics, exploring temporal patterns, and conducting comparative analyses. The core emphasis of these projects is on leveraging SQL for efficient and effective data exploration, enabling the extraction of meaningful insights across different data landscapes.
