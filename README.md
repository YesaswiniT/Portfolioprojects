In this project, we aim to conduct Data Exploration using SQL on COVID datasets encompassing information on both COVID deaths and vaccinations. Our initial steps involve importing and examining the datasets to comprehend their structures and types. Subsequently, we will employ SQL queries for data cleaning, addressing missing values, and ensuring data consistency. Using SQL, we plan to calculate descriptive statistics, explore temporal patterns, and conduct comparative analyses between COVID deaths and vaccination rates. The core emphasis of this project is on leveraging SQL for efficient and effective data exploration, enabling us to extract meaningful insights and contribute to our understanding of the COVID-related data landscape.
